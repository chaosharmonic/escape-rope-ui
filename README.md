# Escape Rope (UI)

## What? (About this Project)

It's a UI for [my job search automation project](https://github.com/chaosharmonic/escape-rope).

For now it's built on React and Vite, but that's just to get basic functionality scaffolded so I have something immediately usable, and I'm still evaluating other options longer-term. Note that, for those reasons, it's not really focused on being performance optimized, and there are still a few things that are broken. (Notably, this has mostly been tested on Chromium browsers, and I'm still working out some of the issues on Firefox. I also don't even *have* any iDevices to test this with.)

## Why? (Motivations)

A lot of reasons. First of all, like I said in the other repo, I built this for me. It's also for the sake of a new demo project -- one that's a little more evergreen than [my last thing](https://github.com/chaosharmonic/step-step-recollection), with usability that isn't location-dependent, and with the added bonus that I can link back to it in all the jobs that my tooling finds me. And there are other, similar personal tasks I may want to handle like this.

It's also various experiments. Later under-the-hood ideas aside, this one is also styled and animated purely in vanilla CSS, and attempts to lean as much on what's offered by native HTML as possible. I'm still working on ripping out the styling bits that Vite auto-generated and attempting to give this a real consistent and thought-out design language, but that's secondary.

The "roadmap" is that I'm building out things in the order that I do need them myself. It's focused on local use, there's no auth, no real user-level settings to speak of, and because this is internally a "for now" design anyway I'm being pretty loose with the code structure. You'll most likely be able to tell where I've put work into this and where I haven't, and that's fine, because again the primary goal of this is to make my life easier.

## How? (Running this project)

(This is mostly a truncated version of the original README generated by Vite.)

### Prerequisites

- The backend linked at the top of this README
- [Deno](https://deno.com/) 1.46 or above
  - Vite itself only requires 1.28, but I'm using later versions for the API

### Running

- Start a dev server: `deno task dev`
- Build production assets: `deno task build`

### Notes

- You need to use `.mjs` or `.mts` extension for the `vite.config.[ext]` file.
- Peer dependencies need to be referenced in `vite.config.js` - in this example
  it is `react` and `react-dom` packages that need to be referenced
